							<div class="title">Bearing Car Weight</div>
							<div class="txt">Tires cushion lowers the impact from the road by bearing the
								car weight, while also transfers the engine power, braking power and change
								of direction to the road to maintain the movement of the car. Tires require
								air injection by adopting the structure and compound to bear the great load
								of cars. Sometimes, the tube inside the tire is used, but in the tubeless
								type in which the rubber that serves as the tube is attached on the inside
								of the tire, the air is injected after the tire is assembled with the wheel,
								and thus requires a firm connection. Moreover, car load and running
								stability can only be guaranteed by maintaining optimal air pressure. Tires
								are developed in various and complicated forms by applying performance and
								wheels due to the recent trend of high quality and high performance in
								vehicles.</div>

								<div class="title">Transferring Driving Power</div>
								<div class="txt">The car power is transferred to the tire through the
									mission, conveying the driving and braking power to the roads. The power
									transmission system of the car transfers the engine power to the running
									tires and moves them toward the direction of the tread that is between
									the road and the tires. If the brakes are applied on the car, frictional
									force occurs in the opposite direction of the one between the tires and
									the surface, which is called the braking power.</div>

								<div class="title">Cushioning the Impact </div>
								<div class="txt">The suspension system connecting the tires to the car body
									absorbs vibration and shock from the roads and determines the ride
									comfort of the car. If there is not enough air pressure, there is
									greater rotational resistance, which generates heat and possibly damage.
									If there is too much air pressure, the flexibility decreases as well as
									the ride comfort. Also, lower aspect ratio of the tire indicates greater
									driving stability than the ride comfort.</div>

							<div class="txt">Transferring power for the car to run or stopping the car is
								done by various devices in the car body, but in the end, tires affect the
								overall driving performance. In the operation of the steering system, the
								driver turns the steering wheel and the operating force is conveyed to the
								steering gear, and at this point the car slows down and the direction
								changes, transferred to the knuckle-spindle through the linkage such as the
								pitman arm, drag link and knuckle arm. The knuckle-spindle rotates around
								the kingpin with such movement, and thus the motion of the front wheels is
								changed. And the knuckles on both sides are linked to tie rods through the
								knuckle arm to create cornering force. If force is given from the side of a
								car driving straight, the force to keep the car straight in response to the
								force occurs between the tires and the road. Also, if the car makes a
								turning movement, centrifugal force is created on the car, and in response
								to this force, the tires create centripetal force around the center of
								turning between the tires and the road in response. This force that occurs
								in the orthogonal direction is called &lsquo;side force.&rsquo; Also, the
								force that occurs in the orthogonal direction of the direction of the tires
								is called the &lsquo;cornering force.&rsquo;</div>
